*Variable radius neighborhood rough sets(VRNRs) and neighborhood rough sets based on α-covering (α-CNRSs) customize the neighborhood radius for each object or local region of the universe by surrounding functions.VRNRs require each object to have a unique neighborhood radius by the surrounding function. Compared with the classic neighborhood rough sets, VRNRs add a process to compute the neighborhood radius of each object.*




## 1. Data Preprocess

We use the ```irisfunctionpredp.m``` file to preprocess the raw data.

## 2. Run model

In the ```VRNRknn.m``` file, we use KNN as the classifier to perform feature selection on the VRNR model.
